# HackTheWorld
Site inspired by the old Hacker Experience, developed as a way to learn React and Node.js.
This project was created as a hands-on approach to study and apply core concepts of modern web development, including:

  - Front-end with React

  - Back-end with Node.js

  - Client-server integration

  - Full stack development practices

The main goal is to recreate the experience of the original site while deepening my knowledge of the technologies used.
